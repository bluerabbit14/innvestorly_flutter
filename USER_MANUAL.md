## 📌 Important Notes

### **Hardcoded Data Mode**
This version of the app uses hardcoded data instead of API calls. All revenue, occupancy, and profile data is served from an in-memory data service. This means:
- No internet connection required
- Data persists only during the app session
- Profile updates are saved in-memory (phone number cannot be changed)
- Restarting the app resets profile changes to default values
- Revenue and occupancy data always returns the same hardcoded values

### **Default Profile Data**
- **Name**: John Doe
- **Email**: john.doe@example.com
- **Phone**: (123) 456-7890

### **Sample Hotels**
The app includes data for three sample hotels:
- **Grand Plaza Hotel** (GPH)
- **Ocean View Resort** (OVR)
- **Mountain Peak Inn** (MPI)
